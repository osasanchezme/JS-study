## JS output

JS can "display" data in different ways:
- **Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.**
- **Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.**
    It simply writes text to the document itself, in the case it already loaded, will overwrite the whole document.
- **Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.**
- **Writing into the browser console, using `console.log()`.**
